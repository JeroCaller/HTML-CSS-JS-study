        Oh, all life of this world, I am Nut, the mother of the sky. 
        I cover the sky, embrace the earth, and create the stars to shed light on your paths.
        I am Ra, the sun god. I raise the sun during the day and the moon at night to gift you time. 
        In this world that I created, you will continue the cycle of life.
        Oh, all life of this world, I am Osiris, the god of death and resurrection. 
        I promise you eternal life. Even after death, your soul will return as a new life.
        You, honor us, the gods, in our names. 
        And this temple will be the place of your prayers and sacrifices. 
        Here, you will receive our blessings.
    </p>
